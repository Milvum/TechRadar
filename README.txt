== Description ==
This is a simple visual wordpress plugin to showcase technologies in a project or organisation.

The tech radar contains four quadrants.
These are the top-left, top-right, bottom-left, and bottom-right.
Colors for items are assigned based on their location.
Items have 3 values: A name, their x coordinate, and their y coordinate.
To avoid cutoffs, be careful with values close to the midway points between quadrants (values around 50).
